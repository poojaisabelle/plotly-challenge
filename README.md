# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity
---

## Data

The data used in this challenge is provided by the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp and can be found [here](https://github.com/poojaisabelle/plotly-challenge/blob/master/samples.json).

---

## Main Objective

The objective was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Task Breakdown

  1. Utilise the D3 library to read in `samples.json`
  2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found for each individual in the dataset 
  3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample. 
  4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
  5. Update each plot and the demographic panel every time a new ID is selected.
  6. Deploy the app to [Github Pages](https://poojaisabelle.github.io/plotly-challenge/)
